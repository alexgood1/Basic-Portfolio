      <p>Hi! I was born and raised in New Orleans, Louisiana. I graduated from LSU in English-Creative Writing in 2015. I am a creative intellectual, and I love programming, as it is a creative activity in a similar relation to creative writing. I begin with an idea, a product, and focus on the story it will tell. Programming, much like writing, consists of piecing the building blocks and significant parts together that create a unique whole - a useful product we can benefit from.</p>

      <p>I worked as the sole Digital Marketer and Social Media Specialist for a privately owned physical therapy business, where I ran marketing campaigns for three clinic locations. Rebuilding the business website led me to editing code and which I quickly discovered my limited capabilities of creating and customizing interfaces online with the little knowledge I had with programming. I grew curious and more interested in learning to program, and began teaching myself the basics with resources online. I decided I wanted to go full into web development and enrolled at UC Berkeley Extension's Full Stack Web Development Program.</p>

      <p>Creating projects to showcase my new programming and technical skills is what I am currently working on, and producing an updated portfolio for myself online for employers to reference my skills and abilities.</p>
